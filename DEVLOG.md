I want to make sure along with the live preview I also fix the broken back state from video to photography

So far that has required a restart

10:31 AM

Ahh man... I'm already thinking about rewriting what I'm currently writing

The video mode should have a live preview, then you can dial in your shot before you start recording

Right now it records immediately

My life is in the process of imploding right now, I did it to myself but yeah

Hard to concentrate when you have multiple robocalls (debt collection) hitting your phone everyday

I do not intend to default on my stuff, I built it up again/had a good credit score but yeah I'm just f'd at the moment

10:50 AM

break

11:19 AM

Back on

1:03 PM

Break, at this point I have a functioning recording preview, adding the timestamp overlay

1:14 PM

I'm gonna try the two streams (high and low) to produce the preview, current approach is slow

let's see if I can add live video preview as it records

7:33 PM

The approach I'm taking right now is to have two separate threads:

1) recording
2) sampling

The SPI-display will take the 2nd one

Then add a pulsing red dot and counter overlay with the image displayed

With this I can change the focus in real time and see the effect

9:22 PM

Alright I'm not sure if I'll succeed in doing this right now, I'm pretty beat

The quick test goal is to be able to run the command, it shows a display livestream (ehhh... need LCD code)

Then record

Yeah... this isn't happening now damn
