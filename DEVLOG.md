let's see if I can add live video preview as it records

7:33 PM

The approach I'm taking right now is to have two separate threads:

1) recording
2) sampling

The SPI-display will take the 2nd one

Then add a pulsing red dot and counter overlay with the image displayed

With this I can change the focus in real time and see the effect
