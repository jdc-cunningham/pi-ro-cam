let's see if I can add live video preview as it records

7:33 PM

The approach I'm taking right now is to have two separate threads:

1) recording
2) sampling

The SPI-display will take the 2nd one

Then add a pulsing red dot and counter overlay with the image displayed

With this I can change the focus in real time and see the effect

9:22 PM

Alright I'm not sure if I'll succeed in doing this right now, I'm pretty beat

The quick test goal is to be able to run the command, it shows a display livestream (ehhh... need LCD code)

Then record

Yeah... this isn't happening now damn
